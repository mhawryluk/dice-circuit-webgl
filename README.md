# Dice Circuit WebGL

[mhawryluk.github.io/dice-circuit-webgl/src](https://mhawryluk.github.io/dice-circuit-webgl/src)

## Description

The animation illustrates an electric circuit of a digital dice. It takes an input of a number from 1 to 6 in a binary form and turns it into seven outputs, each of them corresponding to a single diode on the dice. The simulation lets the user choose a number or "roll the dice" (that is choose it randomly).

The project was created for the Introduction to Computer Graphics class at the AGH UST. It was made using only JavaScript and the Three.js library.
